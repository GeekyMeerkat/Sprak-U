# Sprak-U
Sprak Programs for Else Heart.Break()

Currently this is just two files are no where near completion
helper.sprak needs to be copied and pasted to "ArcadeHall_ArcadeMachine_ArcadeMachine2_6"
menu.sprak "should" be able to work from any computer but has only been tested on Arcade Machines so far

menu.sprak will be using "MemoryPlus", by Erful and assumes that it has been placed on the SteeringComputer

MainFrame is NOT used, as in my game I can't upgrade it with a screwdriver.
So instead, I use "PoliceOfficeInterior_MinistryOfficeWorkstationComputer_1"

Currently menu.sprak provides very few functions:
1. Search through a list of names of characters
2. View information about any character such as: position, bank balance, near by point, current action
3. Interact with most recently searched character: Change bank balance, slurp to near by point

Features I would like to add off the top of my head:
1. Mark people dynamically as friend/foe and save lists in MemoryPlus
2. Set up companion programs to put on recorder computers to mess with enemies or help friends
3. Set up floppy support
  a. An option to read/boot from a floppy
  b. Store floppy names in MemoryPlus with tags so they can be found and retrived quickly
4. Set up a PowerTap Network
5. Add more options for manipulating people through the menu

Step 5 is actually one of the more interesting ones I want to work on. Once I set up menu options to control every trait of a person I can I want to set up another program to control PlayWife. But not in a Sebastian telling her each thing she does, but for her to turn through a loop and act based on things like time of day, weather, who happens to be near by.

It's a shame really. It would be interesting if you could actually set up dialog that PlayWife will have using IG means. I gather you could perhaps do it through editing and adding game files, but it's so unclear how to do that.
